#ICY e-thermostat API

A simple API to communicate with your Icy e-thermostat. I created this so I could fiddle with my e-thermostat. It currently only supports the following:

- login;
- get current and the set temperature;
- set new temperature;

## Requirements

- Node 5.x
- npm 3

## Installation

```
clone
npm install
```

## Running it

```
npm start
```
The server will be running on your localhost port 8000
